PredixPy
========

The Predix Python SDK has been crafted to help Python developers have quick
success writing applications using Predix Services.

Install it from PyPI::

    pip install predix

If that isn't working for you, we highly recommend `The Hitchiker's Guide to
Properly Installing Python`_ to learn about installing ``python``,
``pip``, and ``virtualenv`` for your environment.  For industrial environments, you
may also need to learn how to set your proxies.

.. _The Hitchiker's Guide to Properly Installing Python: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/

See the `Predix Volcano App`_ for a full demonstration of the SDK
used in a Python Flask App.

Getting Started
---------------

Please see the `Getting Started Guide`_ for a walkthrough and
introduction to basic usage of the Python SDK.  The following services are
already supported for **Python 2.7.x**.  Verification of compatibility with
**Python 3.6.x** is on the near-term roadmap.
