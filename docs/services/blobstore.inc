Example
.......

Here is a simple demo to create a blob store instance and basic use example of
listing files.

::

    # How-To Create the service
    # IMPORTANT: You must have already configured UAA and client

    import predix.admin.app
    admin = predix.admin.app.Manifest()
    admin.create_blobstore()


::

    # How-To Use the Service
    # IMPORTANT: this must be run in Cloud Foundry so
    # this example is using Flask methods

    import predix.app
    app = predix.app.Manifest()
    blobstore = app.get_blobstore()

    @api.route('/list')
    def list():
        objs = blobstore.list_objects()
        return jsonify(objs)
